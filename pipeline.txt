What is Pipeline ? 
	We build a pipeline to organize all the steps that we want to do in the building of a model.
	like pre-processing, transformation. etc.

Pipeline with text and Numbers:
	Pipelines with steps for text processing and number processing, can't go together. But there's a sollution to this. There're two tools FunctionTransformer and featureUnion.

FunctionTranform. has a simple job, he takes a python function, and transform to a object that sklearn pipeline can understand.

examples: 

	from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer
	from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion

	get_text_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x['test'], validate=False)

	get_numeric_data = FunctionTransformer(lambda x: x[['numeric','with_missing']], validate=False)

FeatureUnion, can join two pipelines together, after we processed everything in the pipeline. Like separated dataframes to text and number processing.

	from sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion

	union = FeatureUnion([
			('numeric',numeric_pipeline),
			('text',text_pipeline)
	])


joining the two together

	numeric_pipeline = Pipeline ([
		('selector',get_numeric_data),
		('imputer',Imputer())
	])

	text_pipeline = Pipeline([
		('selecctor',get_text_data),
		('vectorizer', CountVectorizer())
	])

	pl = Pipeline([
		('union', FeatureUnion([
			('numeric',numeric_pipeline),
			('text',text_pipeline)

		])),
		('clf',OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression()))
	])
